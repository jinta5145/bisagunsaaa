             <p>
                
                 Red spider lilies symbolize death, especially in Japan and China. There are many myths that claim these flowers grow in Hell and guide spirits to the afterlife, and they're planted in graveyards to keep scavengers away. They only bloom for 2 weeks in autumn, a time associated with death rather than renewal.
